# golfScorer
Golf Scorer Pro was designed for the Pacific Grove Women's Golf League.

The basic functionality is to allow entry of a full seasons' worth of scores, and to use these scores to compute a winner.
Currently, this functionality exists.

Things which will be developed in the future include:

- Ability to view all scores
- Ability to write scores to file/read scores from file
- GUI (I don't think my mom likes Eclipse)
- Ability to dictate a minimum number of games for a golfer to have played to be considered in the final rankings
- Cleaning of inputs, use of try/catch to avoid crashes.
