# golfScorer
Golf Scorer Pro was designed for the Pacific Grove Women's Golf League.

The basic functionality is to allow entry of a full seasons' worth of scores, and to use these scores to compute a winner.
Currently, this functionality exists.

Things which will be developed in the future include:

- <del>Ability to view all scores </del> (added 9/28/16)
- <del>Ability to write scores to file/read scores from file</del> (added 10/4/16)
- GUI (I don't think my mom likes Eclipse)
- Ability to dictate a minimum number of games for a golfer to have played to be considered in the final rankings
- Cleaning of inputs, use of try/catch to avoid crashes.
- <del>Ability to delete golfers and scores</del> (added 9/29/16)
- <del>Ability to modify golfers and scores</del> (delayed for now since users can delete a score and add again)
